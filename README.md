This project implements a Python-based interface that connects to a microcontroller (MC) via USB. It logs data received from the MC every second while facilitating data transmission from the USB to the MC. Key features include:

USB Connection: Establishes a connection with available USB devices upon startup.
Flow Rate Configuration: Allows users to set and adjust flow rates, with the system operating based on these parameters.
Control Buttons: Includes buttons for specific operational purposes.
Data Logging: Receives and stores text data in a log file for future reference.

This project is designed to streamline communication between the microcontroller and USB devices,
